    <p>My collection of neat websites (and a few other things) that I've found during my time on the internet.</p>
        <p>I always try to focus on free resources whenever possible. The rare paid-only stuff is left $20 USD or less (not counting tax) and (B) made by indie creators.</p>
        <p>If anything here breaks in the future, or becomes not-free/more expensive, or is riddled with ads (I use an ad blocker and don't always remember to check the sites), or otherwise becomes sketchy, just let me know and I'll fix it ASAP!</p>

It does this by adding a layer (a "glaze", if you will) over the art that, when said art is added to a AI dataset, causes it to "poison" said set and make it spew out nonsense. Note that this effect, while meant to be unnoticeable to humans, can be seen on art with mostly flat colors. The program can also be pretty demanding on your computer. A browser version does exist and is linked on the site, but in my experince it's had such high traffic that it struggles a lot as well.</p>
