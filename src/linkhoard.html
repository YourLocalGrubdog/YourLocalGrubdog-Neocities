    <p>My collection of neat websites (and a few other things) that I've found during my time on the internet, all in alphanumeric order and filterable by general topic.</p>
    <p><strong>Please note that me linking part of a site here does NOT mean I 100% endorse everything that can be found on that site, nor can I say everything on the site is 100% accurate. Just that there was <em>something</em> worth sharing.</strong> Also, while all links are safe and useable (as in, not broken and not over-run with ads) as of me adding them, I can't promise they'll stay that way. If anything breaks, let me know and I'll remove it ASAP.</p>
    <p>Lastly, I try to focus on free resources whenever possible. Should something ever not be free (as of me adding it), it will [A] be clearly marked [B] be $20 USD or less and [C] made by indie or otherwise "small" creators.</p>
