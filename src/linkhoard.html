    <p>My collection of neat websites (and a few other things) that I've found during my time on the internet.</p>
        <p>I always try to focus on free resources whenever possible. The rare paid-only stuff is left $20 USD or less (not counting tax) and (B) made by indie creators.</p>
        <p>If anything here breaks in the future, or becomes not-free/more expensive, or is riddled with ads (I use an ad blocker and don't always remember to check the sites), or otherwise becomes sketchy, just let me know and I'll fix it ASAP!</p>
        <p>Lastly, I try to describe every site. If I don't describe a site, it's most likely that the site's title is self-explanitory enough. That, or that section has its own rules that are explained up-front.</p>

It does this by adding a layer (a "glaze", if you will) over the art that, when said art is added to a AI dataset, causes it to "poison" said set and make it spew out nonsense. Note that this effect, while meant to be unnoticeable to humans, can be seen on art with mostly flat colors. The program can also be pretty demanding on your computer. A browser version does exist and is linked on the site, but in my experince it's had such high traffic that it struggles a lot as well.</li>

I don't use it for serious drawing anymore, but it was servicable when I did use it for that. Note that some features are behind a prenium version, which costs $3 USD (paid once, not  subscription, thankfuly). You can also purchase it for Windows/Mac for $25.</li>

I don't recommend following it step-by-step, unless you just want to make a practice site to delete afterwards, as they do skip over a lot of helpful file path/organization methods (plus a few other handy things). However, it is great for just seeing it in action before you download anything.</li>

                                    <li>My rather jank fix was to set all my blog posts upload/post time to 12:00:00 (aka midnight) regardless of whatever actual time I posted them. The posts having acturate dates mattered far more to me, and the post time is only going to be visible in RSS readers. If you do care though, uh, ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø good luck lmao</li></ul>

                        <p>Sometimes the lines blur between them, but in short <strong>templates</strong> are pre-made pages with HTML and CSS that just need you to write up some text or upload some images for and <strong>frameworks</strong> are just CSS files that still require you to code a HTML file yourself. Both sometimes also use the word "theme" to describe themselves lol, because life can't be simple. Please be sure to follow any rules/conditions these users have with using their themes and frameworks!</p>
