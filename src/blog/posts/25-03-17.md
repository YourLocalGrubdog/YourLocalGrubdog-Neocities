That's right, the site update is OUT. You should be able to see it now; if not, you may need to hard refresh your browser or clear your cache. 

Like I said before: the core layout is the exact same! Only the aestetics (and some credits) are now diffrent.

Oh! One thing I did add that's new is better embed support. So now linking this site to places will properly display a descripion and an image and stuff. Still tweaking that, too, but I like how it's going so far :3

 There are still some minor issues I'd like to find fixes for, such as the large amount of space above the buttons in the side bar (which is caused by the tape graphic - so I'll either need a smaller one or just no tape on that particular box). Overall, however, things are pretty much done.

That being said, there is something that has been broken on the site for a while that still needs to be fixed: tag pages.

You're supposed to be able to click on the above tag and be taken to a page that lists all other posts that have also been given that tag. These pages do not render properly and have never rendered properly. I attempted to fix this issue with this update. Because 11ty wasn't applying the template to these pages, I decided the best way for me to fix the issue was to simply delete the tag pages and remake them.

And then, uh, 11ty didn't recognize that I had deleted the pages. 

After poking around, I saw that while the pages were deleted from my `src` folder - the one you edit - they were not deleted from my `public` folder - the one actually used to render the site. My *hope* is that, by pushing the update now, 11ty will be able to see the diffrence and sort itself out. Otherwise I'll have a bug squashing session that's far above my pay grade.

So, uh, guess I'll update this post as I go along. Wish me luck.
