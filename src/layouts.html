        <p>Pre-made site layouts and the like that I've made for anyone to use in the making of a webbed site! Have fun :D</p>
    <h2>Chamomile Honey</h2>
        <p>Made for for the <a href="https://32bit.cafe/spring25/" target="_blank">32-Bit Cafe Spring 2025 Tea Party</a>. This is a CSS framework, so it provides CSS styping for as many HTML elements as I could add, plus some classes. It's up to you to put the HTML together into something coherent, however!</p>
